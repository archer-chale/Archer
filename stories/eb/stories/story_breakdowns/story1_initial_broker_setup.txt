Story 1: Initial Broker Setup - Implementation Strategy
===================================================

Objective
---------
Set up the foundational broker component with proper handler structure for different stream types.

Implementation Strategy
---------------------
1. Message Types Setup
   - Create constants.py
   - Define MessageType enum for different types of messages
   - Define StreamType enum for different stream types

2. Core Broker Implementation
   - Create broker.py with AlpacaBroker class
   - Add handler function placeholders
   - Add logging configuration
   - Add thread management basics

3. Thread Management
   - Add _running flag for control
   - Add producer thread tracking
   - Implement thread cleanup on stop

4. Testing Structure
   - Set up proper logger mocking in setUp
   - Test initialization state
   - Test thread creation/cleanup
   - Verify proper shutdown

5. Main Entry Point
   - Set up broker instantiation
   - Handle broker lifecycle
   - Implement clean shutdown on interrupt

Story 1.5: Handler and Producer Setup - Implementation Strategy
=======================================================

Objective
---------
Refactor broker to use dedicated handler functions for each stream type and prepare producer thread structure.

Implementation Steps
------------------
1. Handler Function Structure
   - Add handle_trade_update method
   - Add handle_order_update method
   - Update tests to verify handler existence

2. Producer Thread Structure
   - Add placeholder methods for trade producer
   - Add placeholder methods for order producer
   - Add producer thread tracking properties
   - Update thread management to handle multiple producers

3. Testing Updates
   - Test handler method signatures
   - Test producer thread creation
   - Test producer thread cleanup
   - Verify proper multi-thread shutdown

Success Criteria
--------------
- Handler functions properly defined
- Producer thread structure in place
- Thread management handles multiple producers
- Tests verify new structure
- Clean shutdown still works
- Documentation reflects new approach

Notes
-----
- Each stream type gets dedicated handler
- Producer threads will be implemented in later stories
- Thread management must scale to multiple producers
- Keep handler implementation minimal for now
