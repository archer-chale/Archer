Story 3.5: Broker Containerization - Implementation Strategy
=================================================

Objective
---------
Set up container infrastructure for the broker service to run as a standalone component.

Implementation Strategy
---------------------
1. Service Dependencies
   - Add alpaca-py to requirements.txt
   - Add python-dotenv for environment handling
   - Ensure access to SCALE_T common module

2. Dockerfile Updates
   - Fix path typo (alpaca_broker)
   - Update COPY commands to include common module
   - Set proper CMD to run broker service
   - Ensure proper Python environment

3. Generate Compose Integration
   - Add alpaca_broker service to compose file
   - Configure environment variables for API keys
   - Set up logging configuration
   - Configure container restart policy
   - Add necessary volume mounts

4. Testing Strategy
   - Verify container builds successfully
   - Check service starts properly
   - Validate environment variable passing
   - Test logging output
   - Verify common module accessibility

Integration Points
----------------
- Uses SCALE_T common module for logging
- Shares environment configuration patterns
- Follows project containerization standards

Success Criteria
--------------
- Container builds without errors
- Service runs in container
- Logs are properly captured
- API keys are properly configured
- Common module functions correctly

Notes
-----
- Keep configuration consistent with other services
- Enable proper logging visibility
- Support both paper and live environments
- Prepare for future Redis integration
