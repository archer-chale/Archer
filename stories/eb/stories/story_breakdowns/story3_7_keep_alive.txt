Story 3.7: Keep Container Alive - Implementation Strategy
=================================================

Objective
---------
Ensure the main broker process keeps running indefinitely after starting the producer threads, allowing the container to stay active.

Implementation Strategy
---------------------
1. Main Loop Implementation
   - Add a `while True` loop in main.py after starting the broker
   - Use `time.sleep()` inside the loop to prevent high CPU usage
   - Add proper `KeyboardInterrupt` handling to stop the broker cleanly

2. Shutdown Handling
   - Ensure `broker.stop()` is called on `KeyboardInterrupt`
   - Verify threads are properly joined
   - Add logging for shutdown sequence

3. Testing Strategy
   - Manually test container startup and shutdown
   - Verify logs show proper startup and shutdown messages
   - Check container stays running until manually stopped

Integration Points
----------------
- Uses existing broker start/stop methods
- Follows standard Python practices for long-running services

Success Criteria
--------------
- Container stays running after broker starts
- Service can be stopped cleanly with Ctrl+C
- Logs show proper lifecycle messages

Notes
-----
- This keeps the main thread alive while producer threads run
- Essential for containerized services
- Ensure proper resource cleanup on shutdown
