Story 3: Order Update Producer - Implementation Strategy
=================================================

Objective
---------
Implement order update functionality in the broker using TradingStream, following the producer thread pattern established in Stories 1.5 and 2.

Implementation Strategy
---------------------
1. Order Producer Setup
   - Add TradingStream initialization
   - Add order producer thread method (_run_order_producer)
   - Add order update handler
   - Integrate with existing thread management

2. Order Stream Configuration
   - Reuse existing API key configuration
   - Add paper/live trading mode handling
   - Add order stream settings

3. Producer Thread Implementation
   - Implement proper thread lifecycle
   - Handle stream connection/disconnection
   - Add reconnection logic
   - Add error recovery
   - Coordinate with price producer thread

4. Error Handling
   - Add connection error handling
   - Add order stream error handling
   - Add validation for order updates
   - Add proper cleanup on errors

5. Testing Structure
   - Test order producer thread lifecycle
   - Test order update handling
   - Test error scenarios
   - Test stream reconnection
   - Test coordination with price producer

Integration Points
----------------
- Uses same API keys as price producer
- Uses existing thread management
- Follows established error handling patterns

Success Criteria
--------------
- Order producer thread runs correctly
- Order updates are properly handled
- Errors are properly managed
- Clean shutdown works
- Tests verify functionality
- Both order and price producers work together

Notes
-----
- Focus on order stream only
- Maintain existing price producer functionality
- Use same thread management patterns
- Keep broker class clean and organized
- Consider future Redis integration
