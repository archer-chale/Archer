Redis Implementation Checklist
1. Docker Configuration
File: docker-compose.yml
⦁	Task: Add Redis service configuration
⦁	Details: Define a Redis container with appropriate port mapping (6379), volume configuration for persistence if needed
⦁	Rationale: We need a running Redis instance as the message broker for our pub/sub system
2. Library Structure Setup
File: /main/shared_library/redis/__init__.py
⦁	Task: Create package initialization file
⦁	Details: Export main components for easy importing
⦁	Rationale: Simplifies imports for consumers of our library
⦁	File: /main/shared_library/redis/constants.py
⦁	Task: Define channel name constants and other configuration
⦁	Details: Create CHANNELS class with constants like PRICE_DATA, TRADE_COMMANDS, BOT_STATUS
⦁	Rationale: Provides standardized channel names to prevent typos and inconsistencies
3. Core Library Components
File: /main/shared_library/redis/connection.py
⦁	Task: Implement connection management
⦁	Details: Create RedisConnection class with connection handling, configurable host/port/db
⦁	Rationale: Centralizes connection management logic and configuration
⦁	File: /main/shared_library/redis/publisher.py
⦁	Task: Implement publisher functionality
⦁	Details: Create RedisPublisher class with methods to publish JSON messages to channels
⦁	Rationale: Provides a clean API for publishing messages to Redis channels
⦁	File: /main/shared_library/redis/subscriber.py
⦁	Task: Implement subscriber functionality
⦁	Details: Create RedisSubscriber class with subscription mechanisms, callback registration, and message filtering
⦁	Rationale: Enables services to listen for messages on specific channels and process them
4. Message Handling
File: /main/shared_library/redis/message.py
⦁	Task: Define message structure and validation
⦁	Details: Create Message class with standard fields and validation methods
⦁	Rationale: Ensures consistent message format and validates message content before publishing
5. Testing Components
File: /tests/test_publisher.py
⦁	Task: Create unit tests for publisher
⦁	Details: Test message publishing, error handling, and validation
⦁	Rationale: Verifies publisher functionality works as expected
⦁	File: /tests/test_subscriber.py
⦁	Task: Create unit tests for subscriber
⦁	Details: Test subscription, callback execution, and message filtering
⦁	Rationale: Ensures subscriber properly receives and processes messages
⦁	File: /tests/integration_test.py
⦁	Task: Create integration tests
⦁	Details: Test end-to-end pub/sub functionality with actual Redis instance
⦁	Rationale: Confirms the entire system works together as expected
6. Example Services
File: /examples/example_publisher.py
⦁	Task: Create example publisher service
⦁	Details: Simple script demonstrating how to publish messages
⦁	Rationale: Provides usage example for other developers
⦁	File: /examples/example_subscriber.py
⦁	Task: Create example subscriber service
⦁	Details: Simple script demonstrating how to subscribe and process messages
⦁	Rationale: Shows how to implement callback handling and subscription
7. Documentation
File: /main/shared_library/redis/README.md
⦁	Task: Create library documentation
⦁	Details: Include installation, usage examples, API reference
⦁	Rationale: Helps other developers understand how to use the library
⦁	File: /main/shared_library/redis/requirements.txt
⦁	Task: Define library dependencies
⦁	Details: List redis-py and any other required packages with versions
⦁	Rationale: Makes it easy to install all necessary dependencies
