Phase 1: UI Implementation with Mock Data
1. Create Type Definitions - DONE
File: client/src/types/pubsubmessage.type.ts Why: Define the data structures that will be used throughout the application for consistency.
⦁	Create IMessageTarget interface for defining message recipients (ALL or SELECTED)
⦁	Create IMessageConfig interface for the counter bot configuration
⦁	Create IConfigMessage and IConfigMessageSimple interfaces as specified in requirements

2. Create Routes Path Constants - DONE
File: client/src/routes/routes.path.ts (new file) Why: Centralize route definitions to make navigation consistent and updates easier.
⦁	Define constants for existing routes (DASHBOARD, MESSAGES)
⦁	Will make future route changes simpler to implement

3. Update Messages Page - DONE
File: client/src/pages/Messages/index.tsx Why: Transform the current Logs page into the Message management interface.
⦁	Replace useFirebaseLogs with mock data initially
⦁	Add "New Message" button
⦁	Add state for controlling create message dialog
⦁	Add basic layout structure for the page

⦁	Remove UI elements for sending messages
⦁	Keep service monitoring functionality
Please ask questions to clarify to make sure we are both on the same page


6. Create Mock Hook for Messages
File: client/src/hooks/useMessage.hook.ts (new file) Why: Create a hook with mock data for UI development before implementing backend.
⦁	Implement mock functions for saveMessage, getAllMessages, getMessageDetailsById
⦁	Add state for messages, loading, and errors
⦁	Simulate asynchronous behavior
Phase 2: Backend Integration

7. Create Firebase Message Service
File: client/src/service/firebase/message.service.firebase.ts (new file) Why: Implement Firebase database interactions for storing and retrieving messages.
⦁	Create CRUD functions for messages
⦁	Implement real-time listeners for message updates
⦁	Handle error cases and validation
Please ask questions to clarify to make sure we are both on the same page


8. Create Message Service Controller
File: client/src/service/controllers/message.service.controller.ts (new file) Why: Create an intermediate layer between UI and Firebase for better separation of concerns.
⦁	Add validation logic
⦁	Handle error messages
⦁	Provide clean API for components
Please ask questions to clarify to make sure we are both on the same page


9. Update Message Hook with Real Implementation
File: client/src/hooks/useMessage.hook.ts Why: Replace mock implementations with real Firebase service calls.
⦁	Update functions to use the message service controller
⦁	Maintain same interface so UI components don't need to change
⦁	Add proper error handling and loading states

10. Firebase Function Implementation
Files:
⦁	firebase/functions/src/message/message.database.ts (new file)
⦁	firebase/functions/src/message/message.listener.ts (new file)
⦁	firebase/functions/src/index.ts
Why: Implement server-side functionality for message processing and pub/sub.
⦁	Create database functions for storing and retrieving messages
⦁	Implement listener for new messages to forward to pub/sub
⦁	Update main index to expose new functions
Please ask questions to clarify to make sure we are both on the same page


11. Docker Bot Implementation
Files:
⦁	message_firebase_client.py (new file)
⦁	service.py
⦁	counter_bot.py
Why: Enable bots to receive and process messages.
⦁	Create client for listening to messages
⦁	Update counter bot to process configuration messages
⦁	Add acknowledgment functionality

Phase 3: Testing and Refinement
12. End-to-End Testing
Why: Verify that the entire system works as expected.
⦁	Test message creation and validation
⦁	Test acknowledgment flow
⦁	Test target filtering (ALL vs. SELECTED)
Please ask questions to clarify to make sure we are both on the same page


13. UI Polishing
Why: Improve user experience with better feedback and interactions.
