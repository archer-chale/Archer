Trading Bot System Design Document
Date: February 1, 2025
1. Introduction
Eb Trading Bot is a distributed trading bot system that leverages Docker containers, Firebase for real-time updates, and a client-side React application to provide users with full control and insight into their trading bots. Each Docker container runs a service that focuses on one stock ticker and can manage multiple “mini” trading bots. The system is designed for scalability—from local setups to cloud deployments—and is intended to evolve from simple counter bots to advanced machine learning (ML)-driven trading strategies.
2. Objectives
Modular Deployment: Each stock ticker runs within its own Docker container, allowing for isolated execution and easier scaling.
Real-Time Communication: Use Firebase as a centralized database for status updates and configuration commands via pub/sub messaging.
User Control: Provide a secure, private React client app for users to manage and monitor their trading bots.
Incremental Complexity: Start with a basic command-and-control counter bot and incrementally add trading functionality, stock data logging, and machine learning-driven trading strategies.
Scalability and Flexibility: Allow deployment on local machines or cloud environments with the ability to auto-start/stop services and integrate additional stocks easily.
3. System Architecture Overview
The architecture is divided into several key components:
Docker Containers (Trading Bot Services):
Environment Variables: Each container is configured with variables such as stock ticker, Firebase configuration, and trading API credentials.
Service Logic: Initially runs a simple “counter bot” to simulate trading, later evolving into full trading bots and ML-driven models.
Pub/Sub Listener: Each service listens for commands via a pub/sub mechanism (integrated with Firebase) and responds if the command’s unique ID matches the service ID or targets “all” services.
Firebase Backend:
Real-Time Database: Stores the status of each container, environment configurations, command instructions, and eventually historical stock data.
Authentication: Users access the client app through Firebase’s authentication mechanism. Account creation is managed outside the client app for privacy and security reasons.
Pub/Sub Messaging: Utilized for sending commands to containers. When a container starts, it registers its unique ID with Firebase, and messages are filtered by the container.
Client-Side React Application:
Dashboard: Displays running containers, environment variables, and performance metrics.
Control Panel: Allows users to start/stop bots, send commands (e.g., pause/resume trading, start a counter), and later view aggregated performance dashboards.
Deployment: Hosted on Firebase Hosting for ease of access and scalability.
Data Persistence (Local and Cloud):
Local Storage: Each Docker container logs stock prices and trading data to a local hard drive for historical analysis and machine learning model training.
Cloud Storage (Future Phase): For deployments in cloud environments, this can be expanded to centralized storage solutions.
4. Communication Flow
Service Initialization:
On startup, each Docker container reads its configuration (ticker, Firebase config, trading API credentials).
The container generates a unique service ID and writes its status to the Firebase database.
Command Execution (Pub/Sub):
The client app sends commands (e.g., start counter, pause trading) via Firebase.
Containers subscribe to these commands. If the command’s target ID matches the container’s ID (or is an “all” command), the container executes the command.
The container then updates its status on Firebase (e.g., “counter started”, “trading paused”).
Status and Data Updates:
Real-time updates in Firebase reflect the state of each container.
Stock data and performance metrics are periodically written to the local drive and later used for training ML models.
5. Security and Privacy Considerations
Unique URLs and Credentials: Each user has a unique Firebase URL and credentials, ensuring that trading performance data is private.
Authentication: All operations on the client app require Firebase authentication, limiting access to authorized users.
Container Isolation: Docker containers isolate trading operations per stock, minimizing cross-interference and enhancing security.
6. Project Phases and Milestones
Phase 1: Basic Service & Counter Bots
Core Service Development:
Develop a basic Python service that accepts environment variables (ticker, Firebase config, trading API details).
Implement a unique service ID generation and registration with Firebase on container startup.
Firebase Integration:
Set up a Firebase real-time database to track service statuses.
Configure a pub/sub mechanism for sending and receiving commands.
Client Application:
Develop a simple React app that listens to Firebase for container updates.
Implement a basic dashboard displaying active containers and their environment variables.
Allow user authentication via Firebase (managed through the Firebase console).
Counter Bot Functionality:
Create a “counter bot” within the service that simulates trading operations.
Implement CRUD operations for counter bots: create, read, update (restart), and delete.
Multi-Container Support:
Ensure that the client app correctly displays multiple Docker containers (each associated with a unique ticker).

Phase 2: Transition to Trading Bots & Data Logging
Trading Bot Replacement:
Replace the counter bot with the actual trading bot logic.
Integrate trading API functionality and implement trading strategies (e.g., buy/sell triggers).
Enhanced Data Persistence:
Implement mechanisms for saving stock prices and trading data on the container’s local hard drive.
Begin developing routines to gracefully exit trades (e.g., one hour before market close).
Container Lifecycle Management:
Add functionality for auto-start and stop of Docker containers.
Enable handling of pending trades with logic to execute market orders if limits are not met (e.g., 30 minutes before market close).

Phase 3: Introduction of Machine Learning Models (LLMs) & Advanced Monitoring
LLM Trading Integration:
Develop and integrate a machine learning model (initially for one stock) that makes trading decisions based on historical stock data.
Use paper trading to simulate real-market conditions and evaluate model performance.
Performance Dashboard:
Enhance the React client app to include detailed dashboards that aggregate trading performance (e.g., average daily gains, overall growth).
Include visualization of trading metrics, risk parameters, and historical performance.
Paper Trading Validation:
Establish paper trading accounts and monitor performance against a target (e.g., average gain of 0.5% daily).

Phase 4: Scaling Machine Learning Strategies to Live Trading
Conditional Strategy Replacement:
If the LLM outperforms the traditional trading strategy, transition all services to use the ML-driven approach.
Start trading with real money on one stock while monitoring and adjusting parameters.
Data Collection Expansion:
Deploy Docker containers for 10 additional stocks to gather more data over a 3-week period.
Use collected data to further refine and train new, stock-specific models.
Robust Fail-Safe Mechanisms:
Enhance logic for exiting the market based on predefined limits and emergency triggers.

Phase 5: Full-Scale Deployment & Cloud Integration
Real Money Trading Expansion:
Launch 15 Docker containers running ML-driven trading bots with live money.
Continue to collect and analyze stock data for an extended set of stocks (aim for 30+ stocks over 1 month).
Dynamic Stock Management:
Develop a workflow for easily adding new stocks to the system, including configuration and deployment pipelines.
Cloud Deployment:
Transition from local container management to cloud-based deployments to ensure scalability and reliability.
Incorporate container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) to manage large-scale deployments.
Performance Targets:
Aim for an average gain of over 1% daily.
Provide real-time analytics and monitoring dashboards to track overall system performance.

7. Implementation Roadmap & Next Steps
Prototype Phase 1:
Set up the basic Python service in Docker.
Integrate with Firebase (status updates, pub/sub).
Develop the initial React dashboard with counter bot controls.
Alpha Phase 2:
Replace counter bot with trading logic.
Implement local data logging and auto-start/stop functionality.
Beta Phase 3:

8. Future Considerations
Monitoring & Alerts: Implement monitoring tools and alert systems (e.g., using Firebase functions or third-party services) for real-time incident management.
Security Enhancements: Further secure Docker container communication and API endpoints, possibly introducing additional layers of encryption.
Model Iteration: Continuously refine ML models with new data and integrate feedback loops to improve trading strategies.
User Experience: Improve the client app interface with more granular control over bots and more detailed analytics.

9. Conclusion
This design document outlines the vision and phased approach for developing the trading bot system. Starting with a basic command-and-control setup in Phase 1 and evolving into a sophisticated, ML-driven trading platform, the project is structured to allow incremental enhancements and scalability. As development proceeds, this document should be revisited and updated to reflect new insights, challenges, and opportunities.
