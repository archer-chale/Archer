Frontend (Client-side) Changes
1. Package.json Check/Update
⦁	File: client/package.json
⦁	Reason: Ensure React Router is included for navigation between pages
⦁	Instructions: Check if react-router-dom is installed; if not, add it to dependencies
Ask questions to clarify to make sure we are on the same page
*******
I notice that react-router-dom is not currently installed in your package.json. We'll need to add it.
For the router implementation, do you prefer:
- Let's install react-router-dom and use it for navigation
A simple top navigation bar with links to Dashboard and Logs?
- Yes
A side navigation drawer?
- For mobile, it would be better to have a drawer
Something else for navigation between pages?
- For this let us keep it simple
For the version of react-router-dom, the latest version that would be compatible with your React version (18.3.1) would be react-router-dom v6.x. Is this acceptable?
- Yes
Would you like me to explain how to install react-router-dom, or would you prefer to handle the installation yourself?
- No you could install it.
Do you have any specific styling preferences for the navigation elements that will use the router (e.g., material design, custom styling)?
We will use MUI for the navigation.

2. Firebase Endpoint Service
⦁	File: client/src/service/firebase/firebase-endpoint.service.ts
⦁	Reason: Create a service layer to handle all Firebase database operations
⦁	Instructions:
⦁	Create functions for:
⦁	getServices(): Get all services from Firebase
⦁	sendMessage(message: string, target: string): Send messages to the pub/sub
⦁	subscribeToLogs(callback): Subscribe to log events
⦁	logMessage(containerId: string, message: string): Log messages for debugging

3. Firebase Service Controller
⦁	File: client/src/service/controllers/firebase.service.controller.ts
⦁	Reason: Create a controller that uses the firebase endpoint service
⦁	Instructions:
⦁	Create controller methods that use the endpoint service:
⦁	getServices(): Retrieve services
⦁	sendMessage(message: string, target: string): Send messages
⦁	subscribeToLogs(callback): Subscribe to log updates
Ask questions to clarify to make sure we are on the same page
++++
For the getServices() method:
Should this be a one-time fetch or should it set up a real-time listener for services?
- It will be real time listener
What specific data should we include in the service objects?
- What we currently have displayed
For the sendMessage(message: string, target: string) method:
What structure should we use to store messages in Firebase?
A simple json object {id: string, message: string, target: ("ALL" | <containerId>)}
Should we include additional metadata with the message (e.g., timestamp, sender info)?
- For now we will keep it simple and add the timestamp
For the subscribeToLogs(callback) method:
How should we structure the logs in Firebase?
A simple json object {id: string, message: string, target: ("ALL" | <containerId>), timestamp: string}
What information should each log entry contain besides the timestamp, container ID, and message?
That should be fine for now
Also, we need to implement the Firebase Endpoint Service first since the controller will use it. Should we implement them both at the same time?
Yes this makes sense

+++++
For the form at the bottom of each bot card:
Should it include a text input and send button only?
- Yes, this make this a modal dialog
Do you want the ability to cancel a message after typing it?
 - Yes
For the central form for sending messages to all bots:
Where should this form be positioned? At the top of the page or bottom?
At the top of the page
Should it include a dropdown to select specific bots as an alternative to "ALL"?
- For specific bot selection, it would be better to have the button next to the bot card
For mobile-friendly styling:
Should the bot cards stack vertically on mobile devices?
Yes 
Should the forms have a different layout on mobile?
No 
For the message content:
Is there a character limit for messages?
- No
Should we provide any message templates or suggestions?
- No
